# bootleg-breathing

## To Do

### UI
 - toggle dark/light mode
 - toggle voice
 - toggle chimes
 - end button
 - reset button

### Logic
 - use (local) storage or cookies to keep track of different round times, to display after set
 - stop sounds when entering breathhold (currently finishing 'breath out' during breathhold)

### Sound recordings
 - 'breath in'
 - 'breath out'
 - 'in'
 - 'out'
 - '10 more'
 - 'last one'
 - 'and let it go'
 - 'take a deep breath and hold for 15 seconds'
 - '3, 2, 1, and back into that rhythm'
 - chimes (for during breathhold)
