# bootleg-breathing

## To Do

### UI
 - Shorten welcome message / description

### Logic
 - "don't show again" on welcome message
 - Implement PWA download prompt to relieve server load -> also make it so that the application does not work in the browser itself
 - Remove timing bug (options: debounce, revise logic)

### Sound recordings
 - make sound recordings
 <!-- - 'breath in'
 - 'breath out'
 - 'in'
 - 'out'
 - '10 more'
 - 'last one'
 - 'and let it go'
 - 'take a deep breath in and hold for 15 seconds'
 - '3, 2, 1, and back into that rhythm'
 - chimes (for during breathhold) -->
